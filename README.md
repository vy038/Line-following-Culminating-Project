# Line-following-Culminating-Project
This code was used to create a line following robot for the TEJ3M0 summative project, consisting of two QTI sensors on each side and two motors.

The final project for the Computer Engineering Grade 11 course I was taking involved using QTI sensors to make a line following robot, and at the end of the year, there was a race to see whose robot was the fastest. Mine ended up being one of the fastest, and I was the only one who ended up getting over 100% on the assignment. I added extra sensors so the car can be made to go faster without stepping over the line and also added a bumper so the sensors will not move when bumping into other cars.
